<h2>Behavioral Foundations of Populism and Polarization</h2>

<p>In this page I summarize the scientific output and dissemination activity for my ERC Starting Grant, no. 852526, on "Behavioral Foundations of Populism and Polarization" (POPULIZATION). This grant will be active until November 2025.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

  <p>Since the Great Recession of 2008, populist parties have scored major electoral successes around Europe. Nonetheless, the populist map of Europe has mixed colors: in some countries, voters rally behind right-wing parties promising closed borders while, in others, resentment towards rising inequality has fuelled left-wing movements; some other countries have been less susceptible to populist rhetoric. Why are populist parties more successful in some places (or times) compared to others? What makes right or left populism more prominent in some countries (or after certain crises)? This project tackles these questions with the tools of behavioral political economy, a blossoming field at the intersection of behavioral economics and political economy, which applies insights from cognitive psychology and methodologies from microeconomics to understand political behavior. I will address two fundamental issues that can shed light on the puzzling pattern of support for populism: the heterogeneity and time (in)stability of preferences and cognitive abilities; and the role of limited attention in shaping preferences and information processing. The combined output of these projects will greatly improve our understanding of European citizens' political preferences and how they affect economic and political outcomes.</p>

      <div id="guenther_inequality" class="abstract" style="display:none;">In meritocratic societies, inequality is considered just if it reflects factors within but not outside individuals' control. However, individuals often benefit differentially from other people's efforts. Such passive inequality is simultaneously just and unjust by meritocratic standards, confronting meritocrats with a dilemma. We conducted an experiment with a representative US sample to investigate how people deal with this dilemma. In the experiment, impartial spectators redistribute payments between pairs of individuals. We vary whether initial payments result from luck or effort and whether spectators redistribute between individuals who worked themselves or individuals who benefited from the work of real-life friends. Spectators treat inequality based on the efforts of individuals' friends as if individuals had worked themselves, and very different from inequality resulting from differential luck. This indicates that most people accept passive inequality if it is merited at some stage, which may explain opposition against redistributive policies.

    <div id="mn_selectexposure" class="abstract" style="display:none;"> We report the results of an experiment on selective exposure to information. A decision maker interested in learning about an uncertain state of the world can acquire information from one of two sources which have opposite biases: when informed on the state, they report it truthfully; when uninformed, they report their favorite state. A Bayesian decision maker is better off seeking confirmatory information unless the source biased against the prior is sufficiently more reliable. In line with the theory, subjects are more likely to seek confirmatory information when sources are symmetrically reliable. On the other hand, when sources are asymmetrically reliable, subjects are more likely to consult the more reliable source even when prior beliefs are strongly unbalanced and this source is less informative. Our experiment suggests that base rate neglect and simple heuristics (e.g., listen to the most reliable source) are important drivers of the endogenous acquisition of information.

      <div id="garagnani_framing" class="abstract" style="display:none;">We show that framing an election as a "competition" compared to "cooperation" reduces the chances that egalitarian alternatives will win under Plurality Voting, but not under Approval Voting. Individual voting behavior shows that the effect is mainly driven by voters who switch to their selfish payoff-maximizing alternatives under a competitive framework, but only when those are also payoff-efficient (in terms of the sum of payoffs for the group). This shift does not happen for voters whose payoff-maximizing alternatives are not payoff-efficient, or even if a majority of voters are better off under the payoff-efficient alternative. This suggests that voters are more likely to switch to selfish payoff-maximizing alternatives under a competitive frame if they can (self-)justify the switch in terms of the common good.

    <div id="nz_focusinpolitics" class="abstract" style="display:none;">This paper develops a model of voters' and politicians' behavior based on the notion that voters focus disproportionately on and, hence, overweigh the policies in which politicians' platforms differ more. We introduce focusing in a model of electoral competition between differentiated candidates who invest resources to improve the quality of their policies in multiple common value issues. We show that voters' attention distortion leads to greater investment in policy development, greater platform differentiation (with politicians standing out in the policies they are more competent in), and greater investment in divisive policies. Finally, we show that focusing can contribute to explain puzzling stylized facts such as the entry of single-issue parties with no electoral chances or the inverse correlation between income inequality and redistribution.

<div id="gnn_spillovers" class="abstract" style="display:none;">Negative advertising is frequent in electoral campaigns, despite its ambiguous effectiveness: negativity may reduce voters’ evaluation of the targeted politician but have a backlash effect for the attacker. We study the effect of negative advertising in electoral races with more than two candidates with a large scale field experiment during an electoral campaign for mayor in Italy and a survey experiment in a fictitious mayoral campaign. In our field experiment, we find a strong, positive spillover effect on the third main candidate (neither the target nor the attacker). This effect is confirmed in our survey experiment, which creates a controlled environment with no ideological components nor strategic voting. The negative ad has no impact on the targeted incumbent, has a sizable backlash effect on the attacker, and largely benefits the idle candidate. The attacker is perceived as less cooperative, less likely to lead a successful government, and more ideologically extreme.

  <div id="nn_declaredsupport" class="abstract" style="display:none;">Recent studies of clientelism predominantly focus on how elites use rewards to influence vote choices and turnout. This article shifts attention towards citizens and their choices beyond the ballot box. Under what conditions does clientelism influence citizens’ decisions to express political preferences publicly? When voters can obtain post-election benefits by declaring support for victorious candidates, their choices to display political paraphernalia on their homes or bodies may reflect more than just political preferences. We argue that various factors &mdash; such as the size of rewards and punishments, the competitiveness of the election, and whether multiple candidates employ clientelism &mdash; affect citizens’ propensity to declare support in response to clientelist inducements. Building on insights from fieldwork, formal analyses reveal how and why such factors can distort patterns of political expression observed dur- ing electoral campaigns. We conduct an experiment in Brazil, which predominantly corroborates predictions about declared support and clientelism.

    <div id="garagnani_time" class="abstract" style="display:none;">In a controlled laboratory experiment we investigate whether time pressure influences voting decisions, and in particular the degree of strategic (insincere) voting. We find that participants under time constraints are more sincere when using the widely-employed Plurality Voting method. That is, time pressure might reduce strategic voting and hence misrepresentation of preferences. However, there are no effects for Approval Voting, in line with arguments that this method provides no incentives for strategic voting.

<div id="nunnari_dynbargveto" class="abstract" style="display:none;">In many domains, committees bargain over a sequence of policies and a policy remains in effect until a new agreement is reached. In this paper, I argue that, in order to assess the consequences of veto power, it is important to take into account this dynamic aspect. I analyze an infinitely repeated divide-the-dollar game with an endogenous status quo policy. I show that full appropriation by the veto player is the only stable policy when legislators are sufficiently impatient; and that, irrespective of legislators’ patience and the initial division of resources, there is always an equilibrium where policy eventually gets arbitrarily close to full appropriation by the veto player. In this equilibrium, increasing legislators’ patience or decreasing the veto player’s ability to set the agenda makes convergence to this outcome slower and the veto player supports reforms that decrease his allocation. The main predictions of the theory find support in controlled laboratory experiments.

  <div id="npr" class="abstract" style="display:none;">Rational choice theories posit that citizens accurately evaluate policy options. However, many policies&#8212;such as price controls and Pigouvian taxes&#8212;produce equilibrium effects that citizens may underestimate, potentially leading to support for detrimental policies or opposition to beneficial ones. This under-appreciation may be linked to citizens' cognitive abilities, raising fundamental research questions: Do cognitive abilities influence citizens' preferences over policies? If so, what mechanisms underlie this influence? We employ a theoretical framework and conduct a decision-making experiment involving a UK-representative sample to demonstrate that enhanced cognitive abilities can lead to improved policy preferences. We also uncover the crucial role of beliefs about the cognitive abilities of other citizens: even highly cognitively capable individuals may oppose beneficial reforms if they doubt others' capacity to understand these policies' implications and adjust their behavior accordingly. We assess the external validity of these findings through a survey experiment measuring support for important climate mitigation policies and correlational evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study. We discuss the policy implications of these findings.

  <div id="np_inequality" class="abstract" style="display:none;">We conduct an interdisciplinary meta-analysis to aggregate the knowledge from empirical estimates of distributional preferences reported from 1999 to 2023. First, we examine 297 estimates of sensitivity to inequality from 41 articles in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science, which structurally estimate the Fehr and Schmidt (1999) model. Our analysis indicates that individuals are inequality averse: mean sensitivity to disadvantageous inequality is 0.533; mean sensitivity to advantageous inequality is, instead, 0.326. At the same time, we uncover heterogeneity in estimates and link it to features of the studies: aversion to advantageous (disadvantageous) inequality is smaller (larger) in strategic environments, reflecting that these parameters capture not only distributional concerns but also other motivational forces—such as reciprocity or concerns about intentions. Second, we examine 98 estimates of altruism and attitude towards equity versus efficiency from 17 articles, which structurally estimate the Andreoni and Miller (2002) model. The mean individual has Cobb-Douglas preferences with a weight of around 1/3 on others' earnings. Finally, we do not find compelling evidence of selective reporting or publication bias in either case.

  <div id="rangeeffects" class="abstract" style="display:none;">Several behavioral models assume that choice over multi-attribute goods is systematically affected by the ranges of attribute values. Two recurring principles in this literature are contrast&mdash;whereby attributes with larger ranges attract attention and are therefore overweighted&mdash;and normalization&mdash;whereby attributes with larger ranges are underweighted as fixed differences appear smaller against a larger range. These principles lead to divergent predictions, and yet, both contrast-based and normalization-based models have found strong empirical support, albeit in different contexts and with different experimental designs. The question remains: when does one effect emerge over the other? We experimentally test a unifying explanation: normalization dominates in simple choices, while contrast dominates in complex choices. We conduct an experiment with real-effort tasks in which we manipulate attribute ranges in both simple and complex choices. We find that, indeed, contrast dominates as the number of attributes increases. We also find that contrast emerges with cognitive load induced by time pressure.

  <div id="gn_populism" class="abstract" style="display:none;">Research on the rise of populism has largely overlooked the explanation populists themselves advance: that they fill political representation gaps, defined as discrepancies between mainstream parties’ policies and the "popular will." We test this claim in an information-provision experiment conducted in the weeks leading up to the 2025 German federal election. A sample of 5,040 German citizens was randomly assigned varying information about the immigration stance of Germany’s mainstream center-right CDU—an issue marked by a substantial representation gap. We find that perceptions of the CDU’s position significantly affect both vote intentions and incentivized behavioral measures: when the CDU is perceived as closer to the electorate’s conservative preferences on immigration, support for the right-wing populist AfD declines. Our estimates indicate that the AfD’s vote share would shrink by as much as 75% if the CDU adopted its immigration stance. These results suggest that the electoral success of populist parties is strongly linked to genuine policy preferences, rather than being driven solely by dissatisfaction with political elites or protest voting.

  <div id="invw" class="abstract" style="display:none;">We present a meta-analysis of prospect theory (PT) parameters, summarizing data from 166 papers that report 812 estimates. These parameters capture risk-taking propensities, thus holding interest beyond PT. We develop an inverse-variance weighted method that accounts for correlations in PT parameters and imputes missing information on standard errors. The meanp atterns align with the stylized facts of diminishing sensitivity towards outcomes and probabilities discussed in PT. Beyond this, the analysis yields several new insights: 1) between-study variation in parameters is vast; 2) heterogeneity is difficult to explain with observable study characteristics; and 3) the strongest predictors are experimental and measurement indicators, revealing systematic violations of procedure invariance. These findings highlight the promise of cognitive accounts of behavior in organizing unexplained variation in risk-taking, which we discuss.

<li><p>Benjamin Blumenthal and Salvatore Nunnari, <a href="bn_reciprocity.pdf" target="_blank">Reciprocity and Democratic Accountability</a>, <a href="javascript:showHide('bn_reciprocity');">Abstract</a> 
  <div id="bn_reciprocity" class="abstract" style="display:none;">In this paper we introduce reciprocity concerns in a political agency model with symmetric learning about politicians' ability and moral hazard. Voters with reciprocity concerns are both prospective, i.e., seek to select competent politicians; and retrospective, i.e., reward fair actions and punish unfair ones. We focus on how electoral incentives induce politicians to exert effort (electoral control) and how voters remove incompetent politicians (electoral screening). We show that taking voters' reciprocity concerns into account has important normative implications and can overturn results from standard models that neglect them: increasing transparency about the incumbent's effort improves electoral control if and only if voters have sufficiently strong reciprocity concerns; increasing benefits from office improves electoral control if and only if voters have sufficiently low reciprocity concerns. Moreover, we show that reciprocity concerns can affect electoral screening, by affecting the competence threshold incumbents must clear to ensure reelection, generating incumbency advantages or disadvantages.

  <li><p>Guenther, Laurenz, <a href="guenther_gaps.pdf" target="_blank">Political Representation Gaps and Populism</a>, <a href="javascript:showHide('guenther_gaps');">Abstract</a> 
    <div id="guenther_gaps" class="abstract" style="display:none;">Populists are often defined as those who claim that they fill "political representation gaps" — differences between the policymaking by established parties and the "popular will." Research has largely neglected to what extent this claim is correct. I study descriptively whether representation gaps exist and their relationship with populism. To this end, I analyze the responses of citizens and parliamentarians from 27 European countries to identical survey policy ques- tions, which I compile and verify to be indicative of voting in referendums. I find that policymaking represents the economic attitudes of citizens well. However, I document that the average parliamentarian is about 1 standard deviation more culturally liberal than the national mean voter. This cultural representation gap is systematic in four ways: i) it arises on nearly all cultural issues, ii) in nearly all countries, iii) nearly all established parties are more culturally liberal than the national mean voter, and iv) all major demographic groups tend to be more conservative than their parliamentarians. Moreover, I find that demographic differences between voters and parliamentarians or lack of political knowledge cannot fully account for representation gaps. Finally, I show that right-wing populists fill the cultural representation gap.

      <div id="guenther_weimar" class="abstract" style="display:none;">The recent rise of far-right populist parties is often compared to the rise of Fascism in the 20th century which ended up destroying democratic institutions. This paper analyzes the abolition of the Weimar Republic by the Nazis from the perspective of populism and compares it to the rise of modern populism. We measure populism by analyzing the parliamentary speeches of parties from the Weimar Republic and modern Germany using an established dictionary method. Our main finding is that modern Germany follows a similar trajectory as the Weimar Republic. While the general level of populism was stable over time, both states saw a reversal in which parties were populist. In their early years, left-wing parties were the most populist while right-wing parties became the most populist later.

The principal induces the agent to stay by committing today to tell the agent tomorrow about his chances of promotion the day after. The principal promotes the agent with some probability even after realizing early that the state is bad. The principal may commit not to lead the agent on. Our results apply to worker retention, relationship-specific investment, and forward guidance.
